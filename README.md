Implementation of a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku board.

Algorithm will proceduraly solve a provided Sudoku board until a mistake is made, at which point it will revert to the previous tile and repeat until the board is solved.

A basic visualization of the algorithm's operation and the ability to enter a custom board is provided using the PyGame library.
